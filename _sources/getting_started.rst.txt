*****************************
Getting Started with NWChemEx
*****************************

Superficially the NWChemEx documentation is split into three types of 
documentation, depending on the role you occupy while interacting with NWChemEx: 
an end-user, a collaborator, or a developer. The roles are not exclusive, 
**e.g.**, most developers will be end-users at some point. Nonetheless, start by 
asking yourself: "How do I plan to use NWChemEx?"

If you answered along the lines of:

#. "I want to run a computational chemistry calculation." 

   - Congratulations!!! You are an end-user.
    
#. "I want to interface my existing code with NWChemEx."

   -  Awesome!!! You are a collaborator.

#. "I want to contribute source code directly to NWChemEx."

   - Welcome to the team!!! You are a developer.
   - A link to the developer documentation can be found 
     `here <https://nwchemex-project.github.io/DeveloperTools/>`_
   - The developer documentation is hosted out of the DeveloperTools repo. The 
     documentation references scripts and other tools located in that repo.  

#. "I want to do something else."

   - Either NWChemEx is not the project for you or we missed a scenario. Feel 
     free to contact us using
