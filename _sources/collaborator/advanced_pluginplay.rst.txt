Advanced PluginPlay Primer
***************************

The PluginPlay actually has a lot more functionality than what was showcased in the
PluginPlay primer (TODO: add link). To take maximum advantage of this functionality it 
is recommended you read through the SDE tutorials and/or documentation (TODO:

functionality that is is most likely to be of interest to collaborators. This 
is not intended to be exahustive or comprehensive.
